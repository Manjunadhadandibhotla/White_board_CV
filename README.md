# White_board_CV


"Have you ever dreamt of bringing your artistic visions to life simply by waving your finger in the air? In this project, we'll delve into the world of computer vision and machine learning using OpenCV and Mediapipe to create an Air Canvas. With this innovative technology, you can effortlessly draw anything by merely moving your hands, relying on landmark detection in your hand's knuckles. This project not only offers a fascinating journey into the realms of machine learning but also serves as a compelling addition to your resume. While we'll be utilizing Python, thanks to its extensive libraries and user-friendly syntax, the fundamental concepts can be applied to any programming language supported by OpenCV."
